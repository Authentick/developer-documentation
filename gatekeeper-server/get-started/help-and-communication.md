# Help and communication

If you like to communicate with other developers or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. We're happy to help 😃

## Chat

We have a [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) instance that you can use to chat with other developers. Zulip also offers features for asynchronous communication, so there's no need to feel the urge of being always online.

To join, just press on the link below and register.

## GitHub Discussions

You can also use GitHub Discussions to ask development related questions. Note however that this could be more compared to a regular forum.
