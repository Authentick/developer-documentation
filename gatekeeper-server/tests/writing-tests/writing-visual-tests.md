# Writing visual tests

We use [Percy](https://percy.io) and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) for visual tests, the file that is being executed can be found in [`Server.Tests.Visual/snapshot.js`](https://github.com/GetGatekeeper/Server/blob/main/Server.Tests.Visual/snapshots.js).

The Percy documentation includes details on how to write these tests:
