# Used technologies

Gatekeeper is built on top of other technologies. Whilst much of it should be self-explaining when reading the code, here is further documentation.

## Frontend

The front-end is a Blazor application written in C\# and executed using Web Assembly. Don't worry if you do not have any experience in either, it is pretty straight forward.
